-- question statement
    -- Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users daily
    --(both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03"
    --Round cancellation rate to two decimal points.

    --The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of cancelled (by client or driver)
    --requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

-- create table statement
Create table  Trips (id int, client_id int, driver_id int, city_id int, status varchar(50), request_at varchar(50));

Create table Users (users_id int, banned varchar(50), role varchar(50));

--Solution steps
    --join the trip table with users table twice and filter out the band user
    --once on the client id with user is
    --second driver id with user id
    -- from this temporary table get the sum of total trips and cancelled trips
    -- divide the cancelled trips with completed trips to get cancellation rate
    -- multiply the answer or one of the column by 1.0 to convert the cancellation rate to decimal
